        <h1>Personal Statements</h1>
        <h4>Firstly, I have experience in many coding-related activities and events. Some of these events include coding competitions, such as BEBRAS and PerseCoding Challenges, both of which I have participated in multiple times and from which I have won several awards. Another significant competition I participated in was the National AI Student Challenge 2022, hosted by AI Singapore. In this competition, my group and I won the First Place prize from among groups of students from polytechnics, junior colleges and universities.
          Next, I have taken part in many computing classes. Even back in primary school, I attended an out-of-school course on coding and robotics and even succeeded in coding and making a robot car of my own using Arduino. In secondary school, I chose Computing+ as my applied subject in SST. I have been attending classes and learning about coding and AI, using tools such as XCode, Python and Orange.
          I also consider myself to be well-rounded. Besides computer science-related events and activities, I have also participated in competitions for other subjects, such as Mathematics in the International Math Contest, and Physics through the Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad. My CCA for the last four years has been Fencing. I was a Sports and Wellness House representative in my class, and because of that position, I was able to go and earn 1 Star Kayaking and 2 Star Kayaking certificates. I also attended SEP Archery in 2020.
          Additionally, I have also served my community as a volunteer with organizations such as New Life Community Services and Covenant Evangelical Free Church. My service to the community consists of volunteering for many different activities, which range from planting trees at HDB areas for NParks to helping to facilitate teaching children coding and distributing food to underprivileged families. I have even helped to run booths and teach children during Games Days for Covenant Evangelical Free Church. </h4>
