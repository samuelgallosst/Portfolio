      <h3 class = "centered-text">Talent and Achievement</h3>
      <p class="side-border">Firstly, I have participated in many coding-related activities and events. These include coding competitions, such as BEBRAS and PerseCoding Challenges, both of which I have participated in multiple times and from which I have won several awards. Another significant competition I participated in was the National AI Student Challenge 2022, hosted by AI Singapore. In this competition, my group and I won the First Place prize from among groups of students from polytechnics, junior colleges and universities.
        Next, I have taken part in many computing classes. Even in primary school, I attended an out-of-school course on coding and robotics and even succeeded in coding and making a robot car of my own using Arduino. In secondary school (SST), I chose Computing+ as my applied subject and was a member of SST Inc., SST’s partnership with Apple, for all four years. I have been attending classes and learning about coding and AI, using tools such as XCode, Python and Orange.
        Additionally, I consider myself to be well-rounded. Besides computer science-related events and activities, I have also participated in competitions for other subjects, such as Mathematics in the International Math Contest, and Physics through the Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad. My CCA for the last four years has been Fencing, and I was the Sports and Wellness House representative in my class. With that position, I was able to earn 1 Star and 2 Star Kayaking certificates. I also attended SEP Archery in 2020. 
        Lastly, I have served my community as a volunteer with organizations such as New Life Community Services and Covenant Evangelical Free Church. My service to the community consisted of volunteering for many different activities, which ranged from planting trees at HDB areas for NParks, facilitating teaching children coding and distributing food to underprivileged families. I have even helped to run booths and teach children during Games Day for Covenant Evangelical Free Church and Childrens Fest for New Life Community Services.</p>

      <h3 class = "centered-text">Apptitude and Interest</h3>
      <p class="side-border">I feel confident that, with my passion for learning more about coding and Artificial Intelligence, I possess the necessary aptitude and interest to do well in this course and the computing field.
        Firstly, since I was young, I have always been interested in technology and coding. I attended classes on learning how to code and program, even learning how to program and build a robot car. These experiences have helped me develop my competencies, coding literacy and computational thinking skills.
        One aspect of ICT that particularly interests me is its ability to revolutionise industries and solve problems. One example of this I find particularly interesting is how communication was revolutionised. Technology has improved communication from letter writing, telegrams and mostly face-to-face communication all the way to smartphones with messaging apps, call functions and both local and worldwide video calls. Having learnt how technology can revolutionise industries, streamline processes, and enhance communication on a large scale, I am motivated to be part of this field. I firmly believe that the ICT course at this polytechnic will equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to prosper in the computing and technology field.
        Furthermore, my ability to work effectively in a team setting has been nurtured through various collaborative projects in school. These group projects have taught me the importance of effective communication, adaptability, and the ability to leverage diverse perspectives to achieve shared objectives, an essential skill set in the dynamic world of ICT.
        In conclusion, my passion and interest in ICT, complemented by my demonstrated aptitude, propels me to seek enrollment in the ICT course at your esteemed polytechnic. I am eager to develop skills, deepen my understanding, and contribute meaningfully to and for the ICT industry.</p>
