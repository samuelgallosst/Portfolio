      <h2>Experience:</h2>
      <h3>Coding</h3>
      <p>i. SCRATCH Coding</p>
      <li>
        <a>Samuel attended lessons on Scratch Coding and Robotics and learnt how to code with Scratch and Robotics.</a>
      </li>
      <p>ii. MicroBits Coding</p>
      <li>
        <a>Samuel attended two classes on MicroBits coding. CapitaLand offered one, and the other was at an IT and technology event. He learnt the basics of MicroBits and applied this knowledge to solve tasks set by the instructors.</a>
      </li>
      <p>iii. Arduino Coding</p>
      <li>
        <a>Samuel attended courses and lessons on Arduino UNO coding and learnt to code for robotics, even making a robot of his own that he coded. He achieved the Nullspace Beginner 1&2 and Intermediate 1&2 Arduino Investor Program Certificates of Completion from these courses.</a>
      </li>
      <p>iv. Python Coding</p>
      <li>
        <a>Samuel took the Applied Subject of Computing+ in SST, where he learnt Python Coding and has coded many different school-related coding projects using Python. Some examples of this would be using Python to code for encryption and decryption, promotional materials, and lots more.</a>
